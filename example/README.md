# gatsby-theme-macklinu-portfolio Example

A usage of
[gatsby-theme-macklinu-portfolio](https://github.com/macklinu/gatsby-theme-macklinu-portfolio)
that does nothing but use the theme. This is basically a boiled down version of https://mackie.world that I use for testing while developing the theme styles and Gatsby configurations.
